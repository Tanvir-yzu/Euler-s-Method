# Euler's Method for Solving Ordinary Differential Equations

This C program implements Euler's method for solving first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Euler's method is a simple numerical technique used to approximate the solution of initial value problems for ordinary differential equations.

## Overview

Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are equations that involve one or more functions and their derivatives. Euler's method is an iterative numerical technique used to approximate the solution of a first-order ODE given an initial value.

## Usage

1. **Compile the program:** Use a C compiler such as GCC to compile the program.


Ensure that you have GCC and the standard math library installed on your system.

2. **Run the program:** Execute the compiled program from the command line.


3. **Follow the prompts:** The program will prompt you to enter the initial values, step size, and the number of steps to perform the approximation.

4. **View the results:** Once the computation is complete, the program will display the numerical approximation using Euler's method, the exact solution (if available), and the error at each step.
